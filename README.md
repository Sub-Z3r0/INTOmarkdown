## 2. Uppsetning á vim && git

Everything went according to plan, I mean, it couldn't have been simpler with the instructions.  This was the easy part.

My experience with Ubuntu was not bad. We learned a lot about to handle with github and to work together. Sometimes your description was not so good and it would be better when it´s more detailed.

My experience with ubuntu shell, was that it was equally enjoying as it was abysmal.  I.e, I did in fact enjoy it, but the learning curve was tedious and took some time getting in to the git commands.  
I decided, in this assignment to install Ubuntu exclusively on my machine, replacing W8 all together.  
Experimenting with the shell is enjoyable to some extent.
